My Polymer Samples Repository

Getting Started with my samples:

1. Web server (Apache Http Server, Node Js, or Python Server)
    
	You have must have a web server running in order to run my samples.  I recommend Apache Http Server, go to http://httpd.apache.org/ and download.
	
2. Git clone this repo.

3. Copy this entire folder to a folder on your web server. 

    e.g.  For Apache Http server on windows you will have your docroot at C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs, and you will paste the entire contents of MyPolymer as C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\MyPolymer.
	
4. Open browser and hit the page  http://localhost/MyPolymer/mysamples/index.html then  you can follow the samples available.

Getting Started with Polymer:

https://www.polymer-project.org/

There are few ways to get started with Polymer.  

1. Download all the components in zip files.
2. Use Bower
3. Use Git

If you are beginner, and just want to get things to work, I recommend just downloading the zip.  The contents of the zip are already available in my bower_components folder.  

However if you are serious about Polymer development, I recommend setting up Node Js, and then Bower.  These will help with getting updates to any of the Polymer components or dependencies.
